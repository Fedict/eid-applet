README for eID Applet Project
=============================

=== 1. Introduction

This project contains the source code tree of the eID Applet.
The source code is hosted at: http://code.google.com/p/eid-applet/


=== 2. Requirements

The following is required for compiling the eID Applet software:
* Oracle Java 1.6.0_45
* Apache Maven 3.1.1

Note: the eID Applet does not compile using Java 7 for the moment.


=== 3. Build

The project can be build via:
	mvn clean install

This will also build a test web application EAR artifact named:
	eid-applet-test-deploy

This Java EE 6 web application has been tested on the following Java EE 6/7
application servers:
* JBoss AS 7.x
* JBoss EAP 6.x
* WildFly 7

Deploy the test web application to a local running JBoss application server via:
	cd eid-applet-test/eid-applet-test-deploy
	mvn jboss-as:deploy

During the build process a token is required to sign the applet JAR.
By default the Maven build will use a software token to sign the applet JAR.
One can configure the usage of an eToken via the following Maven property:
	-Petoken
The eToken configuration is located in pom.xml under the eid-applet-package 
artifact.

You can speed up the development build cycle by skipping the unit tests via:
	mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install


=== 4. SDK Release

An SDK build can be performed via:
	mvn -Psdk,etoken clean deploy

The final SDK artifact is located under:
	eid-applet-sdk/target/

An SDK release build should use the production eToken containing the official
FedICT code signing certificate.


=== 5. Eclipse IDE

You can use the m2eclipse Eclipse plugin to import the Maven projects although
the m2eclipse Eclipse plugin does not yet understand the entire project
structure.

Another option is to use the Maven Eclipse plugin.

The Eclipse project files can be created via:
	mvn -Psdk eclipse:eclipse

Afterwards simply import the projects in Eclipse via:
	File -> Import... -> General:Existing Projects into Workspace

First time you use an Eclipse workspace you might need to add the maven 
repository location. Do this via:
    mvn eclipse:add-maven-repo -Declipse.workspace=<location of your workspace>


=== 6. NetBeans IDE

As of NetBeans version 6.7 this free IDE from Sun has native Maven 3 support.
