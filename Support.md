# eID Applet Support Model #

The eID Applet software is provided "as is" according to the GNU LGPL version 3 license. FedICT offers best-effort support on eID Applet GA (General Availability) releases via the eid-applet Google Groups mailing list. Different employees of FedICT are subscribed to this mailing list for answering both technical and non-technical questions. By using a publicly accessible mailing list for the eID Applet support we maximize and open up the shared knowledge on the different technical aspects and deployment aspects of the eID Applet and we hope to stimulate a community effort as part of a long-term high quality solution.

The eid-applet Google Groups mailing list is available at: http://groups.google.com/group/eid-applet

Bugfixes for eID Applet GA releases will be made available with the guarantee for API compatibility until the next major GA release date plus 6 months.
